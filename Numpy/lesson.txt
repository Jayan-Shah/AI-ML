// Why NumPy?
- It provides with large varities of functions and operations to deal with large amount of data...
- It has a very good integration with other libraries like pandas, matplotlib, pytorch, etc..
- It has a good performance : NumPy arrays are better than python lists...
- Using NumPy is quiet easy...

// arr = [1,2,3,4]
arr[-1] = 4
arr[-2] = 3
--> -ve Index is used then check from reverse

// Broadcasting in NumPy
It allows perform arithmetic operations on different size of arrays..
It matches the bigger array size and dimension in order to perform operations..
Rules:-
1. Dimensions are aligned from the right
2. A dimesionn is compatible if:
   - It matches the other array's dimension
   - One of the dimension is 1


// Aggregate functions compute summary and statistics for array...
